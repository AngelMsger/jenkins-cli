# Team setup reference

## Distribution and login

Distribute service settings separately from each member's credentials. An installer
can write a named context without a network connection or access to the keychain:

```bash
jenkins-cli config set-context team \
  --base-url https://service.example.com/deploy \
  --auth-scheme token --activate

# The member completes personal authentication in a terminal.
jenkins-cli --use-context team auth guide
jenkins-cli --use-context team auth login
```

`config set-context <name>` resolves **flags > environment > `.env` > the named
target context > defaults**. It ignores personal environment fields and secrets,
including secret-based scheme inference. It never verifies connectivity, reads or
writes the keychain, or changes another context's values or shared defaults.
Existing usernames remain unchanged. The first context becomes current;
subsequent calls change the current context only with `--activate`.

Identical presets do not rewrite the file. Conflicting non-empty service fields
return `CONFIG_CONTEXT_CONFLICT` with a `details` object containing each field's
`before` and `after` values. Inspect those differences, then use `--overwrite`
to update the supplied service fields, or use another context name. Unspecified
fields are retained. `--dry-run` uses the same merge and conflict checks and
returns the proposed changes without writing anything; use `--overwrite
--dry-run` to preview a deliberate conflicting update.

`auth guide` works offline and emits `server`, `flavor` where applicable,
`scheme`, `credential_url`, `source`, `instructions`, `documentation_url`, and
`next_steps`. Sources are `flag`, `env`, `dotenv`, `file`, `builtin`, or `fallback`.
There is no server-version probe; navigation instructions accompany version-
dependent links.

Token guidance uses `<base-url>/me/security`. Older releases may use the user Configure
→ API Token page; a team can override the link. Both token and basic schemes require the
Jenkins username. Verification checks the authenticated user, rather than treating an
anonymously readable instance page as successful authentication.


Personal login checks the complete normalized service URL before storing a secret,
then records its username and scheme so the next process can resolve it. A URL
mismatch returns `CONTEXT_BASE_URL_MISMATCH`; select or create a matching context.
A `LOGIN_CONFIG_WRITE_FAILED` error reports `credential_stored: true` and its
server/context/scheme; fix file access and repeat personal login. Never replace
an inaccessible host credential with new setup: follow its host recovery first.

Service variables can be injected by the user's shell, launcher, or CI. Add
`JENKINS_AUTH_SCHEME` and optionally `JENKINS_CREDENTIAL_URL`. Environment credentials
remain transient. Do not collect credentials through chat or pass them in command
arguments. See the [installation guide](https://github.com/AngelMsger/jenkins-cli/blob/main/docs/installation.md#team-distribution-and-personal-login)
for distribution examples and the full recovery contract.
